# Token Sale
Add a function where users can mint 1000 tokens if they pay 1 ether.

- IMPORTANT: your token should have 18 decimal places. (It is not standard for ERC20 tokens to have 18 decimals. USDC & USDT has 6,  WBTC has 8. Though most ERC20 tokens have 18 decimals.)
- IMPORTANT: your total supply should not exceed 1 million tokens. The sale should close after 1 million tokens have been minted
- IMPORTANT: you must have a function to withdraw the Ethereum from the contract to your address
