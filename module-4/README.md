[Write-up](https://github.com/eskaine/metana-bootcamp/module-4/write-up.md)

## Deliverables
- Old cleanup
    - Clean up your old code with solhint and prettier. You might need to adjust the maximum line length if the formatting looks funny.
    - Run slither on the final version of your previous assignments. Did it find any errors or were they false positives?
- Add unit tests to the Partial Refund assignment from Module 1 and add unit tests to the forging dapp from Module 3
    - One of the assignments should have 100% line and branch coverage. The other one can have 90% for both. 
    - Run mutation testing on the assignment that has 100% coverage. Did you discover any faulty tests?
- Ethernaut â€“ 1, 2 & 3.
