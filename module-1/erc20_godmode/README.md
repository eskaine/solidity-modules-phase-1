# Module 1 - ERC20 with god-mode
God mode on an ERC20 token allows a special address to steal other peopleâ€™s funds, create tokens, and destroy tokens. Implement the following functions, they do what they sound like:

- mintTokensToAddress(address recipient, uint256 amount)
- changeBalanceAtAddress(address target, uint256 amount)
- authoritativeTransferFrom(address from, address to)
