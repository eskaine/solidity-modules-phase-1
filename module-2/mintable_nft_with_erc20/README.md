# Create an NFT that can be minted with an ERC20 token

You must create 3 separate smart contracts: an ERC20 token, and ERC721 token, and a third smart contract that has the authority to receive ERC20 tokens and mint.

You should create an NFT smart contract that will mint if the user pays 10 ERC20 tokens from a separate ERC20 token that you create. (use 18 decimal places as usual).

Hint: the user will need to approve the transfer of ERC20 tokens first.
